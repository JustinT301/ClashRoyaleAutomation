Basic description:

ignore the pycache and extras folders, you can delete those if you want

golemdeck folder is just a photo album that is used by the cr_ui and cards py files

main.py runs it

cr_ui.py is pretty much just for entering battles, exiting battles, and also determining what to do if you hit 10 elixir

cards.py has many more cards than im using rn, and shows the template of how to set up new cards

coordinates.py is so u can match up the coordinates (specific card placements and region checking) to where the game is set on your monitor
