Basic description:

This python program plays clash royale with a specific golem deck (you can change the cards just by following the format of the cards I used) using image recognition

golemdeck folder is just a photo album that is used by the cr_ui and cards py files

play.py runs it

cr_ui.py is pretty much just for entering battles, exiting battles, and also determining what to do if you hit 10 elixir

cards.py has many more cards than im using rn, and shows the template of how to set up new cards

coordinates.py is so u can match up the coordinates (specific card placements and region checking) to where the game is set on your monitor/

The coordinates I have are set for a 27" Asus Predator monitor with the google play emulator centered in the middle of the screen.

If you have issues due to monitor size or resolution, you may have to retake screenshots of cards or change coordinates.
